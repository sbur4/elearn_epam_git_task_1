Okay yeah yeah.

Try sometimes to say the things you couldn't say
The memory will waste away,
wash away all the things you used to hate
Don't blame your insecurity, about me
Don't even talk about me,
Call me when I'm going crazy,
Power tripping, glowing, we'd be
Drunk and high all night, we
Drunk and high all night, we
Drunk and high all night, we

Don't think about me, don't even talk about me
Call me when I'm going crazy,
Power tripping, glowing, we'd be
Drunk and high all night, we
Don't even talk about me
Call me when I'm going crazy,
Power tripping, glowing, we'd be
Drunk and high all night, we

When do you stop be? Become a celebrity?
I need it this toxic thing called sobriety
Sometimes I feel so broke I run out of energy
Sometimes I get so broke I feel worthless
Taking care of everyone that's broken
Searching for peace in the scenes they don't go after
The ego goes right into the beacon of a happy dream
They say the names of your demons,
It feels wrong.

Try sometimes to say the things you couldn't say
The memory will waste away,
wash away all the things you used to hate
Don't blame your insecurity, about me
Don't even talk about me,
Call me when I'm going crazy,
Power tripping, glowing, we'd be
Drunk and high all night, we
Drunk and high all night, we
Drunk and high all night, we
