Okay yeah yeah.

Try sometimes to say the things you couldn't say
The memory will waste away,
wash away all the things you used to hate
Don't blame your insecurity, about me
Don't even talk about me,
Call me when I'm going crazy,
Power tripping, glowing, we'd be
Drunk and high all night, we
Drunk and high all night, we
Drunk and high all night, we
